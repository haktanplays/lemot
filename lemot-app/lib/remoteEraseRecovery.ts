/**
 * Remote-erase recovery marker (PR-I1, audit C1 — no automatic second-device wipe).
 *
 * When a device discovers the server generation is AHEAD of its acknowledged
 * generation AND it still holds local learner data, the synced data was deleted
 * on another device/session. We do NOT auto-wipe. Instead we persist a
 * USER-BOUND recovery marker, block all sync, and require explicit user
 * confirmation before running the PR-H reset.
 *
 * Stored record: `{ version: 1, userId, targetGeneration }`. On hydration:
 *   - absent           → no recovery pending;
 *   - own valid record → recovery pending (blocked) for this user;
 *   - other user's / corrupt record → recovery pending (blocked), but with no
 *     actionable record — fail closed; do NOT overwrite or reinterpret it.
 *
 * Confirmation (in AppProvider) must verify the marker belongs to the current
 * user, then PR-H reset → acknowledge the target generation → clear the marker →
 * reopen sync. No automatic remote wipe.
 *
 * Pure + harness-testable: reads synchronous; persistence store injectable.
